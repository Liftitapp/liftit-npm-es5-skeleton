| Runner | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start src` | executes the project with live reload enabled via `nodemon` and transpiled with `babel|node`
| `npm run debug src` | executes the project with debug flag enabled
| `npm run benchmark` | runs benchmark tests with `benchmark.js`
| `npm run benchmark:watch` | runs benchmark tests with `benchmark.js` and watch for file changes
| `npm run lint` | code linting with `eslint`
| `npm run lint:fix` | fixes all problems automatically with `eslint`
| `npm test` | runs tests with `mocha` and `chai` with spec as reporter
| `npm run test:watch` | runs tests with `mocha` and `chai` and watch for changes
| `npm run test:reporter` | runs tests with `mocha` and `chai` with `list` reporter
| `npm run test:export` | exports tests results as html files in the `./reports` folder via `mochasome`
| `npm run build` | transpiles and minifies ES6+ code and create sourcemaps with `babel` & `babili`
| `npm run scan:security` | runs vulnerability tests via the node security platform `nsp`
| `npm run scan:updates` | checks for latest versions of dependencies via `ncu`
| `npm run precommit` | runs git hooks with`Husky`
| `npm run prepush` | runs git hooks with`Husky`
| `npm run postmerge` | runs git hooks with`Husky`
| `npm run postrewrite` | runs git hooks with`Husky`

## Start & Debug

`npm start` will run a nodemon server, it listens to any changes and display them on the console
`npm run debug` same as `npm start` plus a port to use as you preffer

Examples:

If you want to run `./src/index.js` should be done like this `npm start src` without adding `index.js` to the path
